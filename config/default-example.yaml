  # currently absolute timeout is 2048 because the largest field is 2048
  # characters long, and the longest normal message is only allowed to be 2000
  # characters (I think?) however if you really wanted to you could set it
  # farther, but you'll have some rejections from the api server. (or you
  # somehow purchased an override from Discord)
